# Esp3D 2.1.X
A compiled version of Esp3D 2.1.x for the ESP8266 NodeMCU V0.0.1 to avoid all compiling problems during the process, but could be ported to any ESP8266 module.

IÂ´m using ESP8266 2.7.4 Core, because the 3.1.2 still having problems with libraries

Thanks to @luc-github for sharing the source code to do this.

These are the parameters followed during the firmware build for the module:
