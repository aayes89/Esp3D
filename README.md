# Esp3D
A compiled version of Esp3D for the ESP8266 NodeMCU V0.0.1 to avoid all compiling problems during the process, but could be ported to any ESP8266 module.

Thanks to @luc-github for sharing the source code to do this.

These are the parameters followed during the firmware build for the module:
